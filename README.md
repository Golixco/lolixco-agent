##  Problem Statement

Entertainment fans crave quick, fun, and helpful conversations about their favorite games, anime, and movies — without spoilers, unnecessary tangents, or needing to search online. Current agents are either too generic or too technical.

---

##  Solution Overview

**Lolixco** acts like a buddy — not just a bot. It combines:
- A hand-crafted knowledge base for precision
- Google’s lightweight `gemma-2b-it` model for freeform responses
- Memory for short-term chat history
- A fully local run — *no API keys required*

---

## ⚙️ Architecture

Lolixco’s architecture is simple and local-first. It checks for KB matches first, then invokes the model if needed.
